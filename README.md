# Hello_world
My first repository
This is my first time to use GisHub, so far so good.
I like this plain text editor platform. It is different. Normally I cannot type to write something, like hand-write. When I do hand-write, I am thinking and writing simultaneously; but when I type, I can just type. But this magic plain view matters, which make me could think while I am typing here, unbelievable.
